Description: QuoteDynamics is an R package that provides fast maximum‑likelihood estimation for high‑frequency bid/ask quote models. The core is a C++ implementation of a multivariate Kalman filter combined with the NLopt optimisation library. Heavy numerical work is done in C++17 with Eigen for linear algebra and NLopt for (derivative‑free) optimisation. Rcpp and RcppEigen handle the interface to R.
